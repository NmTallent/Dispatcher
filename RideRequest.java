/*
 * RideRequest
 * Represents a request by a client for a ride between their current
 * position and some destination.
 * 
 * getClientPosition()
 *    Retrieves the client position.
 *    
 * getDestination()
 *    Retrieves the destination position.
 *    
 * getIsComplete()
 *    Returns true if this request has been completed, false if not.
 *    A new RideRequest starts off as not completed and becomes completed
 *    if the complete method (see below) is invoked.
 *    
 * complete(Driver driver)
 *    If the RideRequest has not yet been completed, updates the 
 *    request to indicate that the request has been
 *    completed and returns a CompletedRide object that captures
 *    information about the completed ride (see CompletedRide interface).
 *    
 *    If the RideRequest has already been completed, simply returns
 *    the CompletedRide object describing the completed ride.
 *   
 * getRideTime()
 *    Returns the Manahattan distance between the client position and the
 *    destination position as a measure of how long the requested ride
 *    will take.
